# Authoring `FORGE.md`

Load this only when a project's forge declaration has to be **written or repaired**. Reading one back needs `SKILL.md` alone.

`FORGE.md` is the project's own answer to *how does a change get from a branch to a reviewed change*. The `lead` reads it directly, before it creates a workspace; a human maintains it. Prose a person can read, not config — but every claim in it must be true enough to bind a command to.

## Where it goes, and what it is called

Exactly `docs/FORGE.md` — a fixed path. Do not rename it, split it across files, or write it anywhere else. Where the project already documents its branch model — a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a section of a `AGENTS.md` — the new file **points at that page and fills the gaps it leaves** rather than restating it.

**Where `docs/BOARD.md` already binds a fact, do not restate it here.** The declaration that owns the *consumer* of a fact names it and cites the other: a branch name derived from a card is consumed by git, so this file owns the derivation and cites `docs/BOARD.md` for the field; attaching a link to a card is the board's, so that file owns it and cites this one for where the link comes from. Shape statements ("one story is one card is one change") may appear in both; only **bindings** are single-sourced.

## If the user says a declaration already exists

Take them at their word — do not hunt for it, and do not write a second one. Only its path matters. Give them the fix: **move the file to `docs/FORGE.md`**, or write a new declaration there that points at the existing page and fills its gaps, per *Where it goes* — then invoke the skill again to read it back, including anything left unbound. Offer to make the move yourself, under the same rule as everything else here: only when they invoked the skill directly, never mid-run.

## Write it only when the user asked for it

Per `SKILL.md`'s *Two ways you are invoked*: interview the user, write the file, and tell them what to check — only on their direct request (a `lead` that stopped for a missing declaration and sent them here counts, since no run is in progress by then), never mid-run, and **never so a stopped `lead` can continue**. **Never write credentials, tokens, cookies, credentialed clone URLs, or private endpoints into it.** Name the mechanism and say it is already authenticated ("the `gh` CLI, already logged in on this machine"). If a reader would need a secret to use what the file describes, describe it differently.

## What it must answer

Ten questions. Ask the user only what the project cannot tell you — read the rest from `git remote -v`, `git branch`, the ignore file, `git log`, the workflows directory, and the shape of already-merged changes.

1. **Which repository, and which remote does the pipeline push to?** Name and URL; whether this checkout is a fork with an upstream, and if so which remote is never pushed.
2. **What is the target branch, and may anything push it directly?** The pipeline's answer is always no — ask so the branch's name is right, and so any allowed merge *into* a story branch is recorded.
3. **Where do story worktrees live, and is that directory in the committed ignore file?** If not, report it: a missing entry lets an ordinary commit step sweep a whole worktree into a story commit.
4. **How is a branch named?** The source — a card field (say which, read through `docs/BOARD.md`), a slug, a prefix convention — and the fallback for a run that names no card.
5. **What convention do commit messages follow, and what must a message name?** Read three real subjects off a **story branch**, not the default branch: a squash-merging repository's default branch shows change titles, not the commit convention.
6. **When does a push happen, and what may never be rewritten?**
7. **Is there a forge? Which one, what does it call a change, and how is it reached?** An already-authenticated CLI, an already-connected MCP server, a documented endpoint, or none. Where two mechanisms are present, say which the bindings use and that the other is deliberately unused.
8. **What is the concrete call for each operation?** *branch · remove a worktree · commit · push · open the change · update it · comment on it · read it back · re-fire the review · merge.* Mark one *not available* rather than omitting it.
9. **What must a change's description carry, and what does it open against?** The section set, the title's shape, whether a later fix round appends or rewrites, and which forge metadata is deliberately unused.
10. **Who reviews an opened change, how is that review fired and re-fired — and what may the pipeline write?** The exhaustive authority, then what stays the human's: merging, force-pushing, rewriting pushed history, deleting refs, tagging, releasing.

## The template

````markdown
# The forge

How this project gets a story from a branch to a reviewed change, read directly at this
fixed path — `docs/FORGE.md` — by the `lead`, before it creates a workspace. Keep it
true, because the pipeline binds real commands to what it says, and because a run
**stops** rather than guess when this file is missing.

## The repository

<Which repository, and which remote the pipeline pushes to. Fork and upstream, if any.>

## Reaching it

<The forge mechanism: a CLI that is already authenticated, an MCP server and its tools,
a documented endpoint — or **none**. Where two are present, which one the bindings use.
No credentials here.> | *there is no forge*

## Branches and worktrees

- **Target branch** — `<name>`. <What branches off it, and that nothing pushes it.>
- **Story worktrees** — `<directory>/<branch>`, covered by the committed ignore entry
  `<entry>`.
- **Branch name** — <where the name comes from, and the fallback when a run names no
  card>.
- **Removal** — <who removes a worktree and its branch, and when>.

## Commits

<The message convention, with two or three real subjects from a story branch. What a
message must additionally name.>

<When a push happens.> Never <the rewrites this project forbids>.

## Operations

- **branch** — <call>
- **remove a worktree** — <call> — *<whose, and when>*
- **commit** — <call>
- **push** — <call> | *not available*
- **open the change** — <call>. <Where the link comes from.> | *not available*
- **update the change** — <call> | *not available*
- **comment on the change** — <call> | *not available*
- **read the change** — <call> | *not available*
- **re-fire the review** — <call> | *not available*
- **merge** — *not available*

## The change artifact

<What the forge calls it, and the word this project uses. One per story, opened against
the target branch, never a second one.>

- **Title** — <its shape, and what happens to it on merge>
- **Description** — <the section set, in order, and whether a fix round appends>
- **Link** — <that it is the open binding's own output, never constructed>
- **<Metadata this project deliberately does not set>** — unused here.

| *there is no change artifact — a run ends at its last commit on the story branch*

## The review

<Who reviews an opened change, how the review is fired, how it is re-fired — the literal
trigger — where findings land, how they re-enter the pipeline, and that nothing waits on
it.> | *no review is configured — say so rather than naming a trigger*

<Any required check the change must satisfy, or that there is none.>

## What the pipeline may write

<The exhaustive list. Default: a branch, a worktree, and commits in it — nothing that
leaves the machine.>

Everything else is the human's, and is reported rather than done:

- **Never merge**, and never enable auto-merge.
- **Never force-push, amend a pushed commit, rebase a pushed branch, or delete a branch,
  a tag, or a remote ref.**
- **Never push the target branch**, commit to it, or check it out in a worktree.
- **Never open a second change for a story, and never close one.**
- **Never cut a release or a tag.**
- **Never touch another repository**, and never add a second remote.

## Worked examples

Four shapes, none privileged. Copy the closest and cut what does not apply.

**A hosted forge over an authenticated CLI** (GitHub via `gh`; the same shape for anything with a first-party command). *Reaching it:* the command, already logged in for whoever runs the pipeline — name no token. *Operations:* `gh pr create --base <branch> --head <branch> --title … --body-file …`, `gh pr edit`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr view --json`, `gh pr diff`. *The change artifact:* a pull request; the description's section set; the link is whatever `gh pr create` printed. *The review:* a workflow in the repository, fired on the change opening and re-fired by a literal comment trigger — **read the workflow's own condition to get that trigger exactly right**; a guessed trigger fires nothing, and a review that never ran looks identical to one that found nothing.

**A hosted forge whose change is called something else** (GitLab via `glab`). The change is a **merge request**, and the declaration records that word — the pipeline's behaviour does not change, but everything it says to a human does. *Operations:* `glab mr create --target-branch`, `glab mr update`, `glab mr note`. *The review:* often an approval rule plus a pipeline rather than a bot — so *re-fire the review* is *not available* and the review is a human approval, which the `lead` reports rather than triggers. *Worth stating:* whether the project squashes, which decides whether the change's title or the branch's commit subjects reach the target branch.

**A forge over MCP.** *Reaching it:* the forge's MCP server, already connected — name the tools for creating, updating, commenting on, and reading back a change. *State explicitly:* **a push is usually still git, not MCP.** Binding *open the change* to a tool while leaving *push* unbound describes a pipeline that cannot ship — nothing is at the remote to open against. Bind both, or mark push unavailable on purpose and say what that means.

**No forge at all.** A repository with a remote but nothing hosted in front of it, or local-only. *The forge:* **none.** *Operations:* branch, commit, and push bound; open, update, comment, re-fire, and merge *not available*. *The change artifact:* none — the run's output is a named branch and a commit range. *The review:* a human reading the branch. **A complete declaration, not a missing one:** the `lead` runs the whole pipeline and ends at its last commit, reporting the branch, the range, and the description content it would otherwise have posted. Only an absent file stops a run.

## Before calling it done

- **The file landed at `docs/FORGE.md`, exactly.**
- **Verified read-only against the real repository:** `git remote get-url <remote>` resolves, `git rev-parse --verify <target-branch>` exists, one already-merged change is located through the *read* binding. **Never verify with a write** — no throwaway branch, test change, or probe comment.
- **The branch-naming rule, run by hand against one real card,** produces a legal ref — no spaces, no `..`, no trailing `/` — and the implied worktree path is writable.
- **Every operation** the project wants is bound; every one it does not is marked *not available* rather than left out.
- **The worktree directory and the run-local scratch path each have a committed ignore entry.** Report a missing one and offer to add it rather than adding it silently.
- **The review section names a trigger a human can actually fire**, taken from the workflow's own condition — or says plainly there is none.
- **No credential got written down**, including inside a clone URL or a command.
- **Nothing restates a binding `docs/BOARD.md` already owns** — that file supplies a card's identity; this one only the branch derived from it.
- Hand the user the file's path, what you verified read-only and against what, and the one or two things you had to assume.
