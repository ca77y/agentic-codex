# Authoring `BOARD.md`

Load this only when a project's board declaration has to be **written or repaired**. Reading back an existing one needs nothing from this file.

`BOARD.md` is the project's own answer to *how do we track work*. Every board-touching agent reads it directly; a human maintains it. It is prose a person can read, not config — but every claim in it has to be true enough to bind a call to.

## Where it goes, and what it is called

Exactly `docs/BOARD.md` — a fixed path, like `docs/AGENTS_IMPROVEMENTS.md`. Do not rename it, split it across files, or write it anywhere else. If the project already documents its board elsewhere — a rules page beside the cards, a section of a `AGENTS.md` — the new file **points at that page and fills the gaps it leaves** rather than restating it; two declarations that can disagree are worse than one that is thin.

## If the user says a declaration already exists

Take them at their word — do not go hunting for it, and do not write a second one. All that matters is whether it is at the fixed path. Tell them so, and give them the fix:

**One old name is worth checking for by hand: `docs/ISSUE_TRACKING.md`.** That is where this declaration used to live, so a project set up against an earlier toolkit has a good declaration no agent reads — and because a board may be absent, its runs go trackerless without complaining. A user reporting the pipeline stopped seeing their board after an upgrade has this cause; the contents need no change.

1. **Move the file to `docs/BOARD.md`,** or write a new declaration there that points at the existing page and fills its gaps, per *Where it goes* above.
2. Then invoke the skill again — it reads the file directly at that path and reports what it says, including anything left unbound.

Offer to make the move yourself, subject to *Write it only when the user asked for it* below.

## Write it only when the user asked for it

- **The user invoked the skill directly** → interview them, write the file, and tell them what to check.
- **A `lead` or `analyst` run is in progress** → never write it; put the draft in your report and let the user decide (per `SKILL.md`, *Two ways you are invoked*).
- **Never write credentials, tokens, cookies, or private endpoints into it.** Name the mechanism and say it is already authenticated ("the Linear MCP server, connected in this workspace"). If a reader would need a secret to use what the file describes, describe it differently.

## What it must answer

Eight questions. Ask the user only what the project cannot tell you — read the rest from the repo, the available tooling, and how existing work is referenced in commits and PRs.

1. **What system holds the work?** Name it, and say whether it is files in this repo or a service.
2. **How is it reached from a session?** A project skill, an MCP server (name the tools), a CLI (name the command and that it is already logged in), repo files, or a documented HTTP endpoint.
3. **How does each operation work?** *locate* a card from a reference, *read* one, *search* for related ones, *create* one, *transition* one. Say plainly when the project does not want one of them available — an unbound operation is a real answer.
4. **What shape is a card?** Where the scaffold or field set is defined, and which field carries identity, type, priority, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Note any format quirk that constrains whoever writes one.
5. **What are the statuses?** The full vocabulary in the board's own words, then which value means *work started* and which means *awaiting review*, plus the value each should be transitioned *from*.
6. **Where must a status write land to be seen immediately?** For a repo-local board that is the root checkout, uncommitted, never a story branch. For a hosted board it is the API call.
7. **What may the pipeline write?** The exhaustive list. Silence here means the two status transitions and nothing else. Every declaration states the writer-specific grant or its absence, the exact fields it covers (which may be none), that the default phase is the initial pre-build spec pass, whether a later respec has a separate grant, and where a repo-local correction would be written. Pipeline-level `update` authority alone does not imply writer authority.
8. **What stays the human's?** Terminal states, unlisted card content, relationships. Name them, so a follow-up is reported rather than applied.

## The template

````markdown
# The board

How this project tracks work, read directly at this fixed path — `docs/BOARD.md` — by
every board-touching agent, with no per-run resolution step in between. Keep it true,
because the pipeline binds real calls to what it says.

## The board

<Name the system, and whether it is files in this repo or a service. One or two sentences.>

## Reaching it

<The mechanism: a project skill, an MCP server and its tools, a CLI that is already
authenticated, repo files, or a documented endpoint. No credentials here.>

## Operations

- **locate** — <how a reference (key, URL, number, slug, path, title) becomes one card>
- **read** — <how a card's goal, scope, acceptance criteria, links, and status are read>
- **search** — <how related cards are found: by subsystem, title, dependency, file region>
- **create** — <how a new card is filed, and at which status> | *not available*
- **transition** — <how a card's status is changed> | *not available*

## Card shape

<Where the scaffold or field set lives. Which field carries identity, type, priority,
dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Any format quirk a writer must respect.>

Acceptance criteria are recorded **one observable behaviour per line** — the acceptance
gate reads them one at a time.

## Statuses

<The full vocabulary, in this board's own words.>

- **work started** → `<value>` (expect `<value>` before writing)
- **awaiting review** → `<value>` (expect `<value>` before writing)
- Terminal states — <values> — are the human's.

## Visibility

<Where a status write must land so it is visible immediately.>

## What the pipeline may write

<The exhaustive list. Default: the two transitions above and nothing else.>

Every declaration distinguishes the update binding from the writer's grant:

- **writer card-content grant** — <present or absent>; if present, it covers only
  `<fields>` during the initial pre-build spec pass.
- **later respec** — <a separately granted phase and fields, or no grant>.
- **correction visibility route** — <the hosted update call, or the named card in
  the repo root checkout on its base branch, left uncommitted and outside the story
  worktree; when the grant is absent, name where an authorised correction would go
  if a future declaration grants one>.

Pipeline-level `update` authority does not itself grant the writer permission to edit
card content.

Everything else — <terminal states, any unlisted card content, relationships> — is the human's. The
pipeline reports follow-ups rather than applying them.

## Worked examples

Three shapes, none privileged. Copy the closest and cut what does not apply.

**Repo-local Markdown.** *Reaching it:* files in this repo, no service. *Operations:* locate `docs/tasks/<slug>.md` by slug or title; read the file; search by grep across `docs/tasks/` including `_backlog/` and `_archive/`; create by copying `docs/_templates/story.md`; transition by editing the card's checkbox symbol. *Statuses:* work started → `[/]` (expect `[ ]` or `[<]`), awaiting review → `[?]` (expect `[/]`). *Visibility:* the root checkout on the base branch, left uncommitted — a card edited on a story branch stays invisible until it merges. *Quirk worth recording:* the kanban view scans files for checkbox markers and surfaces every match, so nested checkboxes create phantom cards.

**A tracker over MCP** (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues). *Reaching it:* the tracker's MCP server, connected in this workspace — name the tools for reading an issue, searching, creating, and updating state. *Operations:* bind each to its tool, and say which team, project, or repository scopes them. *Statuses:* the workflow states as the tracker spells them, exactly. *Visibility:* the tool call itself; no checkout is involved. *Worth stating:* the writer's field-limited initial pre-build spec-pass card-content grant, whether a later respec has a separate grant, whether the pipeline may comment, and whether it may attach the PR link — all are outside the default authority unless this file grants them.

**A CLI or documented REST endpoint.** *Reaching it:* the command, and that it is already authenticated for whoever runs the pipeline. *Operations:* the concrete invocation per operation, with the project key or board id filled in. *Visibility:* the call. *Worth stating:* the rate limit or approval step, if either can make a write fail in a way that looks like a bug.

## Before calling it done

- **Check the file landed at `docs/BOARD.md`, exactly.** Every board-touching agent reads that one path directly; nothing else needs wiring.
- **Verify it against a real card.** Run the `locate` and `read` bindings against a card that already exists — a declaration nobody has read a card through reads as correct right up until a status lands in the wrong place.
- **Check every operation** the project wants available is bound, and every one it does not is marked *not available* rather than left out.
- **Check the status values are spelled the way the board spells them**, including case and punctuation.
- **Check no credential got written down**, including in a URL.
- Hand the user the file's path, what you verified, and the one or two things you had to assume.
